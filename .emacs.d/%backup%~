{\Large Statement of Purpose} \\[.1in]

I am applying to the PhD program at Oregon in order to to continue pursuing academia and my passion for mathematics. Eventually I hope to work as a professor, and play an active part in both research and pedagogy.  My present areas  of interest broadly encompass algebraic topology and homotopy theory. I am also interested in learning about their interactions with other areas in algebra and geometry; as well as related tools such as algebraic K-theory and $\infty$-category theory and their applications throughout mathematics. At UCLA I have taken the first year graduate geometry/topology and algebra courses, and have passed the first year algebra qualifying exam. Additionally, I have finished the graduate algebraic topology sequence and this year I plan to finish the algebraic geometry sequence. If admitted to this program, I would be interested in working with Professor Dan Dugger and Professor Hal Sadofsky. 

My first graduate class in sophomore year was an introductory class in algebraic topology with Professor Michael Andrews. I began to fully appreciate the subject when he assigned the computation of the fundamental group of the Hawaiian earring space for extra credit. The problem stumped most of us for a week; the professor and I figured it out together in his office hours and we ended up showing that it was isomorphic to a subgroup of an inverse limit of finite rank free groups with every letter having finite rank. The problem showed me that topological phenomena actually had incredibly complex and rich algebraic behaviour, and I found this connection incredibly elegant. I knew I had to continue studying the field. I went on to finish the graduate algebraic topology sequence at UCLA and independently read through Mosher and Tangora's Cohomology Operations. After junior year I took a reading course with Professor Mike Hill, who had taught the final course in the algebraic topology sequence. Through him I became acquainted with stable homotopy theory. This past summer and fall quarter I read through the formative papers in the field and went through Ravenel’s \emph{Nilpotence and Periodicity in Stable Homotopy Theory}. 

I enjoy the interplay between abstraction and computation: how greater abstraction aids in the development of computational tools which in turn help classify large scale phenomena; my favorite proof in that book was the proof that $L_{n}$ localization was smashing, which used all this machinery from studying Bousfield classes and reduced the theorem to a computation of an $L_{n}BP$-prenilpotent torsion free spectrum; something completely different that the original statement, but a completely motivated direction of study. Another thing I enjoy is the large number of perspectives people bring to this field through the emphasis on abstraction, such as viewing the thick subcategory theorem as a description of the tensor triangular spectrum of $\mathbf{SH}^{\text{fin}}_{(p)}$. This diversity of perspectives and interconnections pushes me to further explore the field on my own. It is a field that has me deeply captivated and I hope to explore it more. 

I am also interested in other parts of algebra, geometry, and category theory. The summer after sophomore year I took a reading course with Professor Richard Elman on semisimple algebras, including a study of representation theory and of the Brauer group. I thoroughly enjoyed representation theory, and was blown away by the idea that one could compute Morita equivalences classes of CSAs as a cohomological invariant, and especially by period-index problems; I would like to explore using these tools more. I have also given talks in an introductory algebraic K theory seminar and an introductory $\infty$-category seminar aimed at graduate students and faculty. I particularly enjoyed the niceness of certain constructions, such as the construction of the smash product on spectra by using the monoidal structure on presentable stable $\infty$-categories. I am also interested in the ways in which these fields intersect with each other, such as with motivic homotopy theory, which I attended a seminar series on earlier this year. 

Academic study is gruelling and requires a certain amount of fluency with one’s emotions. I learned this the hard way in freshman year, when I had problems with mental health which affected my college performance, in turn affecting my motivation. During a particularly difficult period in the spring quarter of 2017, I realised I needed to put concerted effort into taking care of myself. I was determined to seek help and not to be thrown off course. I started maintaining a philosophy of consistently revisiting the areas that I struggle in, academically or with regard to my health, and in sophomore year I started to improve; for example, I received B+ grades in undergraduate Complex Analysis and Galois Theory, so later on I took the graduate versions of these courses to clear out gaps in my understanding, in both of which I performed better and understood more. I am now much more aware of my cycles of productivity and am well equipped to tackle hurdles in self-directed study, something I expect to be of use in graduate school.

One potential weakness I have is my tendency to pursue tangents and jump further ahead than I am capable of understanding. An example of this is when I took a course in operads and Koszul duality in winter 2019. The course was entirely focused on developing tools to compute the cohomology of differential graded algebras, and having not seen spectral sequences or simplicial objects prior to having taken it, I was lost; though now that I have actually studied ahead, the course content is fairly intuitive and I can now make use of the ideas. As such, with appropriate guidance, it is a habit I can make work for me. 


At Oregon, I am presently interested in the work of Professor Dan Dugger in the fields of equivariant homotopy theory and motivic homotopy theory. I have participated in a seminar on motivic homotopy theory that introduced the set up of the motivic category and I am incredibly interested in learning about which topological phenomena are replicated in this setting. While I am not familiar with equivariant homotopy theory, As with many other students that I have encountered, the fact that powerful results such as the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel work have come about from this field has me greatly interested in learning more about its methods. I am also interested in seeing whether familiar pictures such as the chromatic story are capable of being imported into this setting. I am also interested in the work of Professor Hal Sadofsky as I would like to further pursue stable homotopy theory, and I see that Professor Sadofsky has published extensively in the subject of chromatic homotopy.  

At UCLA I am already a regular attendee of seminars and colloquia, and there are a variety of active seminars at Oregon with which I intend to be as involved as possible. The Cascade topology seminar last year appealed to me in particular, in addition to what appears to be a running homotopy theory seminar on the schedule and a variety of interesting colloquium talks. Much of my intuition in mathematics has developed through work with and influence from fellow students and faculty at UCLA. Conversations in this vein have put me onto a variety of ideas: generalized nilpotence theorems in tt-categories, stacks, algebraic fundamental groups, o-minimal structures, Stone spaces, and much more. Taking graduate classes has allowed me to pick up intuition from the way other students look at challenging problems. Oregon, being such a large department, provides ample opportunity for this level of interaction. As such, I believe I would be a good fit for the program at Oregon.

I thank the admissions committee for their time and for considering my application.
